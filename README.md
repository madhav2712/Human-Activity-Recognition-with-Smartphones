# Human-Activity-Recognition-with-Smartphones


### The objective

Given a database built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. Classify activities into one of the six activities performed. 

### Solution

In the Jupyter notebook you can see an implementation of [Support Vector Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) algorithm using sklean library for python. This supervised learning model implicitly maps their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces and separate in categories. Accuracy of the model achieve 96% after using a recurrent feature extraction with cross validation method.
